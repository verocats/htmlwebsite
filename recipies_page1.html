            Olivier salad is easy to prepare. First, you have to boil potatoes, carrots, and the parsnips. You can boil all of the roots in one pot - so it is faster.
            Then boil the eggs. Eggs should be hard boiled. Further, chicken breast should be boiled as well. Next, cut all the ingresients into small cubes, including 
            pickles, chicken breast and the eggs. Mix everything in a large bowl. Add mayonnaise and a few parsley leaves for decoration. 
            Enjoy!
