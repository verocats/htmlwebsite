                Dressed herring, colloquially known as herring under a fur coat, is a Russian layered salad composed of diced pickled herring covered with layers of grated boiled vegetables, 
                chopped onions, and mayonnaise. Some variations of this dish include a layer of fresh grated apple while some do not.

            Shuba salad is as easy to prepare as the Olivier salad. First, you have to boil potatoes, carrots, and the parsnips. You can boil all of the roots in one pot - so it is faster.
            Then boil the eggs. Eggs should be hard boiled. Further, chicken breast should be boiled as well. Next, cut all the ingresients into small cubes, including 
            pickles, chicken breast and the eggs. Mix everything in a large bowl. Add mayonnaise and a few parsley leaves for decoration. 
            Enjoy!
